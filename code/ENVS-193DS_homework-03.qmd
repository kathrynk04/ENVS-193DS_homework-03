# Problem 1: Personal data

## a. Data summarizing

I could calculate the mean number of minutes I spent studying to compare average time spent studying between days that I consume caffeine and days that I don't because caffeine energizes me, so I think I spend more time studying on days that I consume caffeine. On days that I don't drink caffeine, I think I'm more likely to do more low-energy activities than studying because studying requires more concentration and effort.
